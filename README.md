# lein-gossip

![leiningen\_gossip.clj](doc/dot/leiningen_gossip.clj)

Gossip is a lein tool to generate call-graphs for Clojure code.

This is the first pass and works in a fairly naive way just by treating Clojure code
as data and looking for symbols. It currently doesn't work for Java imports and is
a bit rough around the edges. It was originally written when I inherited a medium
sized codebase written in Clojure and I had no idea what was going on where.

Future Features (Not in any particular order)

1. Show callers from other packages.
2. Handle Java imports.
3. Use an AST library for improved discovery.
4. Use shapes and line types to indicate relationships.

## Important

This tool reads your source code files in src and writes DOT files in docs/dot/. It has been
tested a bit but not widely tested.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

It hasn't erased any of my projects yet (and I'm not sure how it could) but YMMV. But it does
make a directory and create files so use prudcent caution. Make a copy.

## Installation

For now, you can download this project, unpack, cd into the directory and type:

    lein install

Then for any project that you want to use Gossip with, you can add a .lein-classpath file that
points to the src directory of the lein-gossip project.

To use Gossip, type:

    lein gossip

## Future Installation

Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-gossip "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-gossip 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-gossip "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.


## Usage

In your project, type:

    $ lein gossip


By default, Gossip looks in src for Clojure files but will use :source-paths. By default, DOT files
will be placed in project\_name/doc/dot but you can specify a key-path of [:gossip :target] in  your 
project.clj file and it will use that.

You can process them with GraphiViz or OmniGraffle. Use:

    dot -Tpng filename.dt -o filename.png

where you can substitute a variety of formats for png and change the filename appropriately.
